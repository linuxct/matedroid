# RULES TO FOLLOW FOR THIS PROJECT

## Development style

* automatically commit to git any meaningful change, with a short but clear commit message
* follow the "Keep a changelog" and Semantic versioning best practices but DO NOT release major versions by yourself. Ask me if you think they might be released.
* keep an always up-to-date README.md, with instructions on how to install, develop, and the application main features
