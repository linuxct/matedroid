### Feature Guide

#### Dashboard

Your car at a glance: live status, battery level, location on a map, tire pressures, and quick access to all the other sections. The 3D car image matches your actual color, trim, and wheels — tap it for stats, long-press to change the angle. When charging, the battery card comes alive with real-time power and ETA.

#### Charges & Drives

Both screens follow the same pattern: pick a time range, get a summary, swipe through interactive charts, and scroll the full history. Charges can be filtered by AC/DC and track cost. Drives can be filtered by distance category (commute, day trip, road trip) and show efficiency metrics. Tap any chart bar for its exact value.

#### Mileage

Yearly distance overview that you can drill down into: year → month → day → individual drives. Each level shows its own chart and stats. Great for spotting trends or remembering that one road trip.

#### Stats for Nerds

All your personal records in one place — longest drive, top speed, most efficient trip, longest streak, busiest day. Plus aggregated overviews of drives, charges, AC/DC ratio, and temperature stats. Filter by year or go all-time.

#### Battery Health

How your battery is holding up: current vs. original capacity, degradation percentage, range loss, and a degradation chart over time.

#### Software Updates

Update history with installation dates, time between updates, and a chart of update frequency. The version that ran the longest gets a badge.

#### Visited Countries

Every country you've driven through, with flags, distance, energy, and charge count. Sort however you like and tap a country to see its regions.

#### Theming & Notifications

The app themes itself based on your car's exterior color — every Tesla color has its own palette, in both light and dark mode. On Android 16+, you also get live charging notifications with real-time progress and tire pressure alerts in the background.
