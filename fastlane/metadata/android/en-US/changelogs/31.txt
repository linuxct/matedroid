Live charge links now gracefully adapt to your TeslaMate API version.

Fixed:
- Dashboard charging gauge and details row only navigate to the live charge screen when TeslaMate API 1.24+ is detected
- Charging notification only deep-links to live charge when the endpoint is available; otherwise opens the app normally
