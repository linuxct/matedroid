Take control of your Tesla data with MateDroid, the companion app for Teslamate that puts your driving and charging history in your pocket.

<b>Your Data, Your Server, Your Privacy</b>

MateDroid connects exclusively to your self-hosted Teslamate instance. No cloud services, no accounts, no tracking. Your Tesla data never touches our servers because there are none. This is how privacy should work.

<b>Beautiful at a Glance</b>

See your Tesla's real-time status on a stunning dashboard featuring a 3D model that matches your car's actual color and wheels. The entire app theme adapts to your vehicle's color, creating a personalized experience in both light and dark modes.

<b>Everything You Want to Know</b>

• <b>Live Dashboard</b> - Battery, range, charging status, climate, tire pressures, and more
• <b>Drive History</b> - Every trip mapped with efficiency stats, elevation profiles, and weather conditions along the way
• <b>Charging Sessions</b> - Track where you charge, how much energy you add, costs, and charging curves
• <b>Battery Health</b> - Monitor degradation over time with clear visualizations
• <b>Stats for Nerds</b> - Tap the car for deep statistics: records, extremes, AC vs DC charging ratios, and hidden gems

<b>Offline Ready</b>

MateDroid syncs your data locally so you can browse your drives and charges even without an internet connection. Perfect for checking your trip history while on the road.

<b>Requirements</b>

This app requires a working Teslamate + TeslamateApi setup:
• Teslamate: github.com/adriankumpf/teslamate
• TeslamateApi: github.com/tobiasehlert/teslamateapi

If you're already running Teslamate, you're just one API deployment away from using MateDroid.

<b>Free and Open Source</b>

MateDroid is 100% free with no ads, no in-app purchases, and no premium tiers. The complete source code is available on GitHub under the GPL-3.0 license. Contributions welcome!
